## Focus on Pollinators

We love pollinators!  They pollinate more than 2/3 of the world's crops, and nearly 70% of the world's flowering plants.  In our country alone, more than 100 crops need pollinators.

In wild ecosystems, pollinators are keystone species. Fruits and seeds derived from insect pollination are a major part of the diet of approximately 25 percent of all birds, and of mammals ranging from red-backed voles to grizzly bears. In many places, the essential service of pollination is at risk from habitat loss, pesticide use, and introduced diseases.

As we have added native plants to our landscape over the last ten years, we've seen more interesting pollinators every year:  bees, beneficial wasps, odd beetles, and hummingbirds.  We also see more native songbirds, because our gardens support insects that the birds feed to their young, as well as wild berries and flower seeds.

We carry many great flower species for pollinators, as well as numerous flowering and fruiting native shrubs.

**No Nicotinamides!**  We love honeybees and our native bees!

**No pesticides.**
