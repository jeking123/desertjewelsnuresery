<h2>What is a Penstemon?</h2>
<p>There are 270 different Penstemon species, and countless hybrids and cultivars.  Most are native to North America, and a few are native to Mexico.  A large number of Penstemon species are native to the northwest.</p>
<p>Penstemons come in many colors, red, pink, white, yellow, orange, blue, and purple.  They come in many forms: tiny rock garden gems, herbaceous matted forms with tall flower spikes, and low shrubs from a few inches wide to 4 or 5 feet wide.</p>

<p>Many Penstemon species are hardy and adapted to harsh, dry conditions. Firecracker Penstemon, <strong><em>Penstemon eatonii</em></strong>, a desert dweller, attracts hummingbirds to the garden.</p>   

<br /><br />

<p>Some grow on rock cliffs.</p><br />

<p>This is our local Shrubby Penstemon, <strong><em>P. fruticosus</em></strong>, on a rock wall along highway 2 in Pend Orielle County, Washington.</p><br />

<p>This species and its cultivars are long lived in the garden.   The shrubby Penstemon is evergreen, with a reddish-maroon cast in the winter, and loads of large flowers in the spring.</p><br />

<p>Some grow in shallow rocky soils.
<br><br>
This is the Rock Penstemon, <em><strong>P. rupicola</em></strong>, in a rocky, dry garden bed.  They are native to the Cascades Mountains of Oregon and Washington.  They do appreciate an occasional watering.  They donï¿½t mind shade for part of the day, but are also fine with full sun.  The pink flowers and bluish, evergreen foliage are quite beautiful.
<em><strong>Penstemon rupicola</strong></em> would be lovely in a small rock garden or trough.</p>
<p>A few species of Penstemon grow in moister sites.</p>  
<p>The Cascades Penstemon, <em><strong>P. serrulatus</em></strong>, grows in the Cascades Mountains of Oregon and Washington. It makes a dramatic addition to the perennial flower border, and is one of the most widely adapted Penstemon species.  It can grow in quite a bit of shade, and tolerates moister conditions. </p>
<p>Another Penstemon species that tolerates moister conditions is the Foxglove Penstemon, <strong><em>P. digitalis</em></strong>.  This species blooms in early summer, and thrives & naturalizes in my Spokane garden far better than any other Midwestern Penstemon species I have trialed.</p>

<p>All perennials and most small shrubs are grown at our nursery, many from wild collected seeds.</p>
